//! The `session` module contains an implementation of the Willow General Purpose Sync Protocol
//! (WGPS).
//!
//! It exposes a few public types used to initiate sessions, and the [`intents`] module which
//! contains handle, event and command types for controlling sessions.
//!
//! Internally, this module contains the full implementation of the protocol, which is started with
//! the `run_session` function (which is not public).
